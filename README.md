API url: https://syoft.dev/Api/userlogin/api/userlogin

Sample Payload:
{
    "user_email":"mail@gmail.com",
    "user_password":"123456"
}

After Login In store user information in local storage and redirect user to dashboard page and in dashboard page just show the user information (try to show your creativity here).


Note: 
Framework should be React.
Both APIs are POST API, and you should submit JSON object for those.
Design should be responsive.
There should be form validations on fields like whether field is filled or not and whether the given information is valid or not.
